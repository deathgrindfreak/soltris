SOLTris
=======
SOLTris is a tetris clone I made in an attempt to learn the SDL game library 
and hone my C programming skills.

In an attempt to be at least a little original, I've made the colors of the
tetrominoes and the board correspond to the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark color scheme

Also, this project is still a work in progress and is buggy as hell, so feel free to add to it if you like.

Installation
------------

####Linux
If you wish to install the game, first clone the repo:

    git clone http://github.com/deathgrindfreak/soltris.git

You'll also need the following libraries:

[SDL 1.2](http://libsdl.org/download-1.2.php), [SDL_ttf 2.0](http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf) and [SDL_mixer 1.2](http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer)

In Debian or Ubuntu this should install them:

    sudo aptitude install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

Then simply build and run:
    
    make
    ./tetris


####Windows
I haven't tested on Windows yet, but take a look at this [tutorial](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/index.php) on installing SDL
in Windows if you're interested in trying it out.
